# 🌦️ Weather App

A simple and clean weather-checking application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**, using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. This project helped me understand how to connect front-end interfaces with real-time external data.

---

## Project Purpose

This was created as part of my hands-on learning journey into web development. The goal was to apply fundamental concepts like:

- Fetching and displaying external data (APIs)
- DOM manipulation
- Responsive UI layout using Flexbox
- Handling errors and user input

---

## Key Features

- Search for any city to view its current weather  
- Shows temperature, humidity, and wind speed  
- Dynamic weather icons based on live data  
- Error handling for invalid input or network issues  
- Clean and responsive layout  

---

## 🌱 What I’ve Learned

This project helped me practice:

- Using `fetch()` with `async/await` to call APIs  
- Parsing JSON responses and safely accessing data  
- Updating the UI dynamically through JavaScript  
- Working with condition-based icon switching  
- Writing clean, maintainable code  
- Organizing files into folders for scalability

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

I plan to expand this project further by adding:

- Geolocation-based weather (auto-detect user’s location)  
- 5-day forecast section  
- Dark/Light mode toggle  
- Multi-language support (including Japanese)  
- Display local time of the searched city

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Replace the API key in `script.js` with your own from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)  
3. Open `index.html` in your browser  
4. Type a city and press **Enter** or click **Search**
